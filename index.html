        <h2>What I Adore in Dr. Kalam</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has always been an inspiration to me — not just because he was a scientist or a President, but because he was humble, visionary, and deeply connected with the youth of our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I truly adore is his simplicity in lifestyle and greatness in thoughts. He believed that every child has the power to change the world. His vision for India 2020, his love for teaching, and his never-give-up spirit make him a true role model.
        </p>
        <p>
          His ability to convert failures into stepping stones, his deep spirituality, and his unshakable belief in the youth of India prove that a great soul leads not by position — but by purpose.
